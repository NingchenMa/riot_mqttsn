## Linear Acceleration Sensor
The LinearAccelerationSensor measures acceleration that is applied to the device hosting the sensor, excluding the contribution of a gravity force. When a device is at rest, for instance, lying flat on the table, the sensor would measure â‰ˆ 0 m/s2 acceleration on three axes.

## Activity recognition Model
After reading several papers about Human Activity recognition (HRA) [1] [2] I decided to use to build a simple model (PoC) using the Linear acceleration sensor sampling at 1 Hz, creating a 4 sampling window and analyzing two features:
